## Azure Application Insights

The solution uses [Azure Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/) to easily query application level traces and to automatically get telemetry data like request latencies, success rates etc.

Note that currently upto 1GB of telemetry can be sent without any charge. If you want to disable Application Insights, you can look at instructions in our [FAQ](https://github.com/abhi1509/Product-Recommendations/blob/master/doc/troubleshooting-and-faq.md#q-how-can-i-disable-application-insights).
