## Product Recommendations Sample

This sample in the CS folder is a C# sample that shows how to use an API endpoint generated by
the Recommendations preconfigured solution. You can find more details on the Recommendations preconfigured solution 
 https://aka.ms/recotemplate. 
 
 The sample demonstrates how to:
 
 1. Train a product recommendations predictive models based on  historical transaction data and information on the product catalog.
 2. Get Item-to-Item Recommendations from a trained model. 
 3. Get Personalized Recommendations from a trained model.
 4. Set a model to be the default model, and request recommendations from the default model.
  
## Pre-Requirements
The steps below are explained in more detail in the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/abhi1509/RecoPreview/blob/master/getting-started.md)
 
 1. Before you can run the application you need to deploy the Recommendations Template. Deployment instructions are at https://github.com/abhi1509/RecoPreview/blob/master/doc/deployment-instructions.md
2. You will get an API Key as part of the deployment process and the url of your solution. 
Set the apiKey and recommendationsUri variable based on those values.

3. You will need to upload catalog and usage data for training to a blob storage container.
It is important to note that you copy your usage and evaluation files to distinct **folders**, 
while you provide the location of the catalog **file**.
     
 Based on that, you will need to set the following variables: 
 blobContainerName, string trainCatalogFileRelativeLocation,
 trainUsageFolderRelativeLocation and evaluationUsageFolderRelativeLocation
